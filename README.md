# My Personal Portfolio

* For my portfolio website, I wanted simple website that is easy to navigate. 
I wanted a design that was striking. To me the most important features included functional links to social media and the ability to be able to contact me via a functional form. High on my agenda was a strong and simple platform that I can build upon as I grow my portfolio.

# Inspiration
 To begin with the website that gave me the biggest inspiration was margo weathers website, I loved the landing page with a full screen video background and the dark color scheme.

I also seen another Melbourne developers portfolio website which included a screenshot of a map of Melbourne as a background which I liked the idea of. I came up with the concept of incorporating the two ideas together and creating a website which had a short 25 second or so video around Melbourne/coding looped as the background. 

Other Pages that initially gave me some inspiration were

# Wireframes

*This is the color palette that I decided upon

This was a very basic wireframe I made for my first concept.

I then made two more, one mainly tech orintated and a minimal one.

# Challenges and Changes

So I started off with a very dark color scheme for everything except for the landing page which proved very difficult as it looked horrible, I tried for a long time to make it a little more user friendly, in the end I decided to scrap that idea and start with a cleaner, brighter and more minimalistic approach.

Two quotes I found that pretty much sum what I was experiencing. 

“In spite of the striking visual impact that these dark designs can have, many designers don’t know how to effectively pull them off without turning off the visitor.

“With a dark design comes less readability, less appeal for most readers and less opportunity for conventional design elements.”


  The importance of a focused development phase became clear in this project. My initial wireframing led me to settle upon a layout that would translate across a wide range of viewport sizes. This was an important consideration. I made significant changes to the project at a late stage as I became aware of several readability issues caused by my initial choices.
